This repository presents my work in TCAD-based device simulation and reliability analysis as part of my M.Tech VLSI Design program.
My primary focus areas include:
- IGZO thin-film transistor (TFT) device modeling
- Electrical parameter extraction from TCAD simulations
- Mixed-mode device–circuit simulation
- Radiation-induced Single Event Upset (SEU) analysis using LET-based heavy-ion modeling

The work emphasizes understanding device physics, transient behavior, and reliability effects relevant to advanced and radiation-aware electronic systems.

# Tools & Methods
- TCAD Device Simulation: SILVACO ATLAS
- Mixed-Mode Simulation: TCAD–SPICE
- Radiation Modeling: LET-based heavy-ion SEU simulation
- Analysis: DC, transient, and recombination analysis
